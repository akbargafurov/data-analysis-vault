# Champions League 2023-2024: the travel effect on away teams

*does distance traveled affect away teams' performance? a data-driven investigation into the UEFA Champions League?*

---

## the big question: does travel distance matter in european tournament?

every year, clubs across europe compete in the **UEFA Champions League**, a tournament that requires not only tactical prepardness but also extensive travel. while some teams like *Paris Saint-Germain* and *Dortmund* travel barely two thousand kilometers for their away matches, others like *Galatasaray* and *Union Berlin* cover well above five thousands.

this project takes a **data-driven approach** to uncover whether *long journeys* negatively impact *away teams' results* in the 2023-2024 Champions League season (group stage). using *match results* and *distance traveled*, i explore how travel affects *match outcomes*.

## what i am investigating

- how much in total does each team travel during the group stage?
- how many away points does each team score during the group stage?
- is there a correlation between traveled distance and away points scored during the group stage?

by analyzing travel distance and match statistics, i aim to uncover **hidden patterns** and **data-driven insights** into the role of travel in elite football.

## methodology: how i analysed the data

1. data acquisition
    - scrapped match data for all Championes League games.
    - scrapped stadium locations for all competing teams.
    
2. data processing
    - cleansed match and stadium data for easy analysis.
    - calculated travel distances for each away match.

3. statistical analysis & visualization
    - measured Pearson and Spearman correlation between travel distance and away teams' performance.
    - created a scatter plot to illustrate findings.

## key findings: the impact of travel distance on away team performance

based on the away points vs distance traveled correlation chart, we can draw the following insights:

1. weak negative correlation (-0.05 Pearson, -0.08 Spearman)
    - the correlation coefficients suggest a very weak negative relationship between travel distance and points earned in away games.

2. top-performing away teams travel both short and long distances
    - some teams like Bayern Munich (BAR), Real Madrid (RMA), and Manchester City (MCI) have achieved high away points despite varying distances.

3. teams with lower points often traveled further 
    - teams such as Galatasary (GS), Sevilla (SEV), and Celtic (CEL) traveled longer distances and secured fewer away points.
